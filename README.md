# Executioner
An experiment to determine the difference in performance between model-based and model-free agents in a PDDL environment.

### stripper-main
This directory contains the files of the script used to convert PDDL domains with typing to domains based only on STRIPS. \n
The script runs in the command line and alters PDDL files so they will require only STRIPS.
